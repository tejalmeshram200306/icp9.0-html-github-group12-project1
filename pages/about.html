        <h2>Introduction to Cricket</h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team.</p>

        <h2>How Cricket is Played</h2>
        <p>Cricket involves two main roles: batting and bowling/fielding. The game is played in innings, where one team bats to score runs while the other team bowls and fields to restrict the runs and dismiss the batsmen.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Batting:</strong> The batting team has two players on the field at a time. The batsman aims to hit the ball bowled at them to score runs by running between the wickets or by hitting boundaries (4 runs for hitting the ball to the edge of the field, 6 runs for hitting it over the edge on the full).   </li>

            <li><strong>Bowling and Fielding:</strong> The fielding team has all eleven players on the field. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, aiming to get them out by hitting the stumps, catching the ball, or other methods of dismissal. Fielders support the bowler by catching the ball and preventing runs.

The game evolved over the centuries, and the first international match was played in 1844 between the United States and Canada. The sport's greatest popularity, however, is found in the Commonwealth countries.</p>
